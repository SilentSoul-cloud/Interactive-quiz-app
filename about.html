      <p style="max-width: 900px; text-align: center; font-size: 1.3em">
        <strong>MindMetric</strong> is a simple, fun, and beginner-friendly
        quiz app built using basic web technologies like HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. It was created as a learning project to explore how
        real-world websites work — from page navigation and UI design to saving
        high scores using browser storage.

      <br />

      <p style="max-width: 900px; text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em">
        The goal of this project is to help beginners (including the creator!)
        understand how interactive web pages function, especially with DOM
        manipulation and storing data locally using <code>localStorage</code>.

        Since this is a learning project made with limited experience, you may
        notice a few bugs or parts that can be improved. Please know that it is
        still under development and may be updated in the future as skills grow
        and feedback is received.

        Thank you so much for trying it out! Whether you're just playing the
        quiz or looking at the code, your time here means a lot. This small
        project is a step forward in the journey of learning web development.
