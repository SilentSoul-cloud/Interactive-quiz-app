# Interactive Quiz App

A beginner-friendly interactive quiz web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project allows users to test their knowledge with multiple-choice questions, get instant feedback, and see their score at the end. Designed as a hands-on learning project, the codebase is simple and open for future improvements.

## ✨ About

This project was inspired by [James Q Quick](https://www.youtube.com/@JamesQQuick) and his [YouTube tutorial series on building quiz apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFWbAj40JrQ&list=PLB6wlEeCDJ5Yyh6P2N6Q_9JijB6v4UejF). While the initial logic and style were based on his content, I made my own choices and modifications as I built the app.

**This is a beginner learning project—expect rough edges and room for improvement!**
